In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Combining two ggplot2 graphs\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Combining three ggplot2 graphs\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\np1 + p2 / p3\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\n2.5.4 Creating a composite figure with tag\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.5 Creating figure with insert\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, left = 0.02, bottom = 0.7, right = 0.5, top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Creating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork &\n  theme_economist() &\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=8))"

Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young,size = Population,colour = Country)) +\ngeom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) + \n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}',x = '% Aged', y = '% Young')+\n  transition_time(Year) + \n  ease_aes('linear')          \n\n\n\n\nThe animated bubble chart"

    "text": "3.4 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods\nggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n3.4.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.1 Displaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     #&lt;&lt;\n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         #&lt;&lt;\n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) #&lt;&lt;\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), #&lt;&lt;\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.1 Customising Tooltip style\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css &lt;- \"background-color:white; #&lt;&lt;\nfont-style:bold; color:black;\" #&lt;&lt;\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  opti\n\nNotice that the background colour of the tooltip is black and the font colour is white and bold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to Customizing girafe objects to learn more about how to customise ggiraph objects.\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Displaying statistics on tooltip\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.\n\ntooltip &lt;- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {   #&lt;&lt;\n  mean &lt;- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy) #&lt;&lt;\n  sem &lt;- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy) #&lt;&lt;\n  paste(\"Mean maths scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem) #&lt;&lt;\n} #&lt;&lt;\n\ngg_point &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n                   aes(x = RACE),\n) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS, \n                   tooltip = after_stat(  #&lt;&lt;\n                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  #&lt;&lt;\n    fun.data = \"mean_se\", \n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,  #&lt;&lt;\n    fill = \"light blue\"\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS),\n    fun.data = mean_se,\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, size = 0.2\n  )\n\ngirafe(ggobj = gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\nCode chunk on the left shows an advanced way to customise tooltip.

Different from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:\n\nby using plot_ly(), and\nby using ggplotly()\n\n\n3.7.1 Creating an interactive scatter plot: plot_ly() method\nThe tabset below shows an example a basic interactive plot created by using plot_ly().\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH)\n\nThe output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Working with visual variable: plot_ly() method\nIn the code chunk below, color argument is mapped to a qualitative visual variable (i.e. RACE).\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~ENGLISH, \n        y = ~MATHS, \n        color = ~RACE) #&lt;&lt;\n\nInteractive:\n\nClick on the colour symbol at the legend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating an interactive scatter plot: ggplotly() method\nThe code chunk below plots an interactive scatter plot by using ggplotly().\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(dotsize = 1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nggplotly(p) #&lt;&lt;\n\nNotice that the only extra line you need to include in the code chunk is ggplotly().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.4 Coordinated Multiple Views with plotly\nThe creation of a coordinated linked plot by using plotly involves three steps:\n\nhighlight_key() of plotly package is used as shared data.\ntwo scatterplots will be created by using ggplot2 functions.\nlastly, subplot() of plotly package is used to place them next to each other side-by-side.\n\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)  #&lt;&lt;\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\nClick on a data point of one of the scatterplot and see how the corresponding point on the other scatterplot is selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight_key() simply creates an object of class crosstalk::SharedData.\nVisit this link to learn more about crosstalk,"

    "text": "2.2 Critique: Clarity and Aesthetics\n\nClarity\n\nThis chart fails to demonstrate several observations made by our classmate:\n“…a clear disparity emerges between the average unit prices of condominiums and apartments, standing at approximately $1,500 and $2,000, respectively, for the period spanning January to March…”\n\nThe chart doesn’t provide clear information about the average unit prices of condominiums and apartments. The absence of labels, compounded by the use of a violin plot that highlights distribution, adds to the complexity.\n\n“…Noteworthy is the discernible uptick in both unit price and transaction volume from January to March 2024…”\n\nTransaction volume is particularly challenging to discern compared to unit price because the y-axis is focused on describing unit prices.\n\n“…Despite an overall reduction in total transactions vis-a-vis the preceding year, there is an unmistakable trend towards growth within specific sub-markets, suggesting an increasing inclination towards higher-value properties…”\n\nThe x-axis represents the three months of Q1 2024 instead of displaying transaction volume, a metric frequently referenced by the author. Utilizing the x-axis to depict transaction volume would enhance clarity significantly..\n\nOther concerns:\nThe title provides a general description but lacks specificity. It does not specify the time period covered by the visualization, nor does it offer insight into the context or main focus of the visualization. A more detailed title and subtitle would enhance clarity and understanding for the audience.\nThe x-axis represents the three months of Q1 2024 instead of displaying transaction volume, a metric frequently referenced by the author. Utilizing the x-axis to depict transaction volume would enhance clarity significantly.\n\n\n\nAesthetics\n\nThe color selection is problematic due to the light-colored background, which matches the hue of the violin plot. This makes it strenuous for the eyes to distinguish between elements.\nFonts, titles, x-ticks, and legends are small and difficult to discern."

    "text": "3.1 Proposed Sketch\nA violin is often not well understood by the general public. In this case, the use of a violin plot is worse as the writer intends to make several comparisons that are not obvious from said plot.\nThis scenario seems appropriate for a similar makeover done by Michael Djohan for another student.\nAcknowledging that point plots may distract and add little value, we omitted them. Instead, a modified bar chart resembling a violin plot was adopted. This alternative retains the visual appeal of a violin plot while providing clearer and more informative comparisons. We also decided to add annotations for median prices and transaction volume. A facet plot is used to distinctively compare between the three months for Q1 2024."

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\nHow to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.

    "text": "3.4 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods\nggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n3.4.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.1 Displaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     #&lt;&lt;\n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         #&lt;&lt;\n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) #&lt;&lt;\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), #&lt;&lt;\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.1 Customising Tooltip style\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css &lt;- \"background-color:white; #&lt;&lt;\nfont-style:bold; color:black;\" #&lt;&lt;\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  opti\n\nNotice that the background colour of the tooltip is black and the font colour is white and bold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to Customizing girafe objects to learn more about how to customise ggiraph objects.\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Displaying statistics on tooltip\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean.

It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n3.4.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.1 Displaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     #&lt;&lt;\n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         #&lt;&lt;\n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) #&lt;&lt;\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), #&lt;&lt;\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field.

    "text": "29.6 Introducing tidytext\n\nUsing tidy data principles in processing, analysing and visualising text data.\nMuch of the infrastructure needed for text mining with tidy data frames already exists in packages like ‘dplyr’, ‘broom’, ‘tidyr’, and ‘ggplot2’.\n\nFigure below shows the workflow using tidytext approach for processing and visualising text data.\n\n\n29.6.1 Removing header and automated email signitures\nNotice that each message has some structure and extra text that we don’t want to include in our analysis. For example, every message has a header, containing field such as “from:” or “in_reply_to:” that describe the message. Some also have automated email signatures, which occur after a line like “–”.\n\ncleaned_text &lt;- raw_text %&gt;%\n  group_by(newsgroup , id) %&gt;%\n  filter(cumsum(text ==\"\") &gt;0,\n         cumsum(str_detect(\n           text, \"^--\")) ==0) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk:\n\ncumsum() of base R is used to return a vector whose elements are the cumulative sums of the elements of the argument.\nstr_detect() from stringr is used to detect the presence or absence of a pattern in a string.\n\n\n\n\n\n29.6.2 Removing lines with nested text representing quotes from other users.\nIn this code chunk below, regular expressions are used to remove with nested text representing quotes from other users.\n\ncleaned_text &lt;- cleaned_text %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(text, \"^[^&gt;]+[A-Za-z\\\\d]\")\n         | text == \"\",\n         !str_detect(text, \n                     \"writes(:|\\\\.\\\\.\\\\.)$\"),\n         !str_detect(text, \n                     \"^In article &lt;\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk:\n\nstr_detect() from stringr is used to detect the presence or absence of a pattern in a string.\nfilter() of dplyr package is used to subset a data frame, retaining all rows that satisfy the specified conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n29.6.3 Text Data Processing\nIn this code chunk below, unnest_tokens() of tidytext package is used to split the dataset into tokens, while stop_words() is used to remove stop-words.\n\nusenet_words &lt;- cleaned_text %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, text) %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(word, \"[a-z']$\"),\n         !word %in% stop_words$word)\n\nNow that we’ve removed the headers, signatures, and formatting, we can start exploring common words. For starters, we could find the most common words in the entire dataset, or within particular newsgroups.\n\nusenet_words %&gt;%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 5,542 × 2\n   word           n\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n 1 people        57\n 2 time          50\n 3 jesus         47\n 4 god           44\n 5 message       40\n 6 br            27\n 7 bible         23\n 8 drive         23\n 9 homosexual    23\n10 read          22\n# ℹ 5,532 more rows\n\n\nInstead of counting individual word, you can also count words within by newsgroup by using the code chunk below.\n\nwords_by_newsgroup &lt;- usenet_words %&gt;%\n  count(newsgroup, word, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n29.6.4 Visualising Words in newsgroups\nIn this code chunk below, wordcloud() of wordcloud package is used to plot a static wordcloud.\n\nwordcloud(words_by_newsgroup$word,\n          words_by_newsgroup$n,\n          max.words = 300)\n\n\n\n\nA DT table can be used to complement the visual discovery.\n\nDT::datatable(words_by_newsgroup , class= \"newsgroup\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29.6.5 Visualising Words in newsgroups\nThe wordcloud below is plotted by using ggwordcloud package.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk used:\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nwords_by_newsgroup %&gt;%\n  filter(n &gt; 0) %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(label = word,\n           size = n)) +\n  geom_text_wordcloud() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~newsgroup)"

    "text": "29.7 Basic Concept of TF-IDF\n\ntf–idf, short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection of corpus.\n\n\n\n29.7.1 Computing tf-idf within newsgroups\nThe code chunk below uses bind_tf_idf() of tidytext to compute and bind the term frequency, inverse document frequency and ti-idf of a tidy text dataset to the dataset.\n\ntf_idf &lt;- words_by_newsgroup %&gt;%\n  bind_tf_idf(word, newsgroup, n) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(tf_idf))\n\n\n\n29.7.2 Visualising tf-idf as interactive table\nTable below is an interactive table created by using datatable().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29.7.3 Visualising tf-idf as interactive table\nThe code chunk below uses datatable() of DT package to create a html table that allows pagination of rows and columns.\n\nDT::datatable(tf_idf, filter = 'top') %&gt;% \n  formatRound(columns = c('tf', 'idf', \n                          'tf_idf'), \n              digits = 3) %&gt;%\n  formatStyle(0, \n              target = 'row', \n              lineHeight='25%')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk:\n\nfilter() argument is used to turn control the filter UI.\nformatRound() is used to customise the values format. The argument digits define the number of decimal places.\nformatStyle() is used to customise the output table. In this example, the arguments target and lineHeight are used to reduce the line height by 25%.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about customising DT’s table, visit this link.\n\n\n29.7.4 Visualising tf-idf within newsgroups\nFacet bar charts technique is used to visualise the tf-idf values of science related newsgroup.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk used to prepare the plot.\n\ntf_idf %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(newsgroup, \"^sci\\\\.\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(newsgroup) %&gt;%\n  slice_max(tf_idf, \n            n = 12) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(word = reorder(word, \n                        tf_idf)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(tf_idf, \n             word, \n             fill = newsgroup)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ newsgroup, \n             scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(x = \"tf-idf\", \n       y = NULL)\n\n\n\n29.7.5 Counting and correlating pairs of words with the widyr package\n\nTo count the number of times that two words appear within the same document, or to see how correlated they are.\nMost operations for finding pairwise counts or correlations need to turn the data into a wide matrix first.\nwidyr package first ‘casts’ a tidy dataset into a wide matrix, performs an operation such as a correlation on it, then re-tidies the result.\n\n\nIn this code chunk below, pairwise_cor() of widyr package is used to compute the correlation between newsgroup based on the common words found.\n\nnewsgroup_cors &lt;- words_by_newsgroup %&gt;%\n  pairwise_cor(newsgroup, \n               word, \n               n, \n               sort = TRUE)\n\n\n\n29.7.6 Visualising correlation as a network\nNow, we can visualise the relationship between newgroups in network graph as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk:\n\nset.seed(2017)\n\nnewsgroup_cors %&gt;%\n  filter(correlation &gt;

    "text": "Building Interactive Network Graph with visNetwork\n\nvisNetwork() is a R package for network visualization, using vis.js javascript library.\nvisNetwork() function uses a nodes list and edges list to create an interactive graph.\n\nThe nodes list must include an “id” column, and the edge list must have “from” and “to” columns.\nThe function also plots the labels for the nodes, using the names of the actors from the “label” column in the node list.\n\nThe resulting graph is fun to play around with.\n\nYou can move the nodes and the graph will use an algorithm to keep the nodes properly spaced.\nYou can also zoom in and out on the plot and move it around to re-center it.\n\n\n\nData preparation\nBefore we can plot the interactive network graph, we need to prepare the data model by using the code chunk below.\n\n\nShow the code\nGAStech_edges_aggregated &lt;- GAStech_edges %&gt;%\n  left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c(\"sourceLabel\" = \"label\")) %&gt;%\n  rename(from = id) %&gt;%\n  left_join(GAStech_nodes, by = c(\"targetLabel\" = \"label\")) %&gt;%\n  rename(to = id) %&gt;%\n  filter(MainSubject == \"Work related\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(from, to) %&gt;%\n    summarise(weight = n()) %&gt;%\n  filter(from!=to) %&gt;%\n  filter(weight &gt; 1) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the first interactive network graph\nThe code chunk below will be used to plot an interactive network graph by using the data prepared.\n\n\nShow the code\nvisNetwork(GAStech_nodes, \n           GAStech_edges_aggregated)\n\n\n\n\nWorking with layout\nIn the code chunk below, Fruchterman and Reingold layout is used.\n\n\nShow the code\nvisNetwork(GAStech_nodes,\n           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %&gt;%\n  visIgraphLayout(layout = \"layout_with_fr\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit Igraph to find out more about visIgraphLayout’s argument.\n\n\nWorking with visual attributes - Nodes\nvisNetwork() looks for a field called “group” in the nodes object and colour the nodes according to the values of the group field.\nThe code chunk below rename Department field to group.\n\n\nShow the code\nGAStech_nodes &lt;- GAStech_nodes %&gt;%\n  rename(group = Department) \n\n\nWhen we rerun the code chunk below, visNetwork shades the nodes by assigning unique colour to each category in the group field.\n\n\nShow the code\nvisNetwork(GAStech_nodes,\n           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %&gt;%\n  visIgraphLayout(layout = \"layout_with_fr\") %&gt;%\n  visLegend() %&gt;%\n  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with visual attributes - Edges\nIn the code run below visEdges() is used to symbolise the edges.\n- The argument arrows is used to define where to place the arrow.\n- The smooth argument is used to plot the edges using a smooth curve.\n\n\nShow the code\nvisNetwork(GAStech_nodes,\n           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %&gt;%\n  visIgraphLayout(layout = \"layout_with_fr\") %&gt;%\n  visEdges(arrows = \"to\", \n           smooth = list(enabled = TRUE, \n                         type = \"curvedCW\")) %&gt;%\n  visLegend() %&gt;%\n  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit Option to find out more about visEdges’s argument. ]\n\n\nInteractivity\nIn the code chunk below, visOptions() is used to incorporate interactivity features in the data visualisation.\n- The argument highlightNearest highlights nearest when clicking a node.\n- The argument nodesIdSelection adds an id node selection creating an HTML select element.\n\n\nShow the code\nvisNetwork(GAStech_nodes,\n           GAStech_edges_aggregated) %&gt;%\n  visIgraphLayout(layout = \"layout_with_fr\") %&gt;%\n  visOptions(highlightNearest = TRUE,\n             nodesIdSelection = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  visLegend() %&gt;%\n  visLayout(randomSeed = 123)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit Option to find out more about visOption’s argument."
